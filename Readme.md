# Info
  This app was created using VS .Net 2010. The 1.2+ version of the source code is available.
It uses Wpf for front-end (UI) and C# for back-end.
In order for the sound to work the program needs a file located in "C:\Windows\Media\", called
"chord.wav", if that file is not found, the sound will be disabled. It also uses, 24 (0-23) hour format 
so anyone who wants to test/try this source code may want to take that into account.
'Source' folder contains the working source code.

# Credits

Wpf on msdn.microsoft.com.
